## üöÄ **Project Overview**
With the rapid spread of deepfake videos and audio, there is an increasing need for reliable detection systems that not only identify fake content but also proactively protect against alterations. Guard.AI addresses these challenges by:
- **Real-time deepfake detection** across images, audio, and video.
- **Proactive immunization**: Prevents future alterations to protected media using proprietary algorithms.
- **Decentralized storage and verification** through blockchain and IPFS technologies.
  
Guard.AI offers a comprehensive defense against deepfakes by ensuring content remains authentic and trustworthy.

## üí° **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Deepfake Detection**: Uses advanced machine learning to analyze and flag manipulated media. 
- **Proactive Media Immunization**: Applies unique signatures to media files to protect them from future deepfake attempts.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Utilizes blockchain for content verification, with community-driven voting on content authenticity.
- **Cross-Platform Browser Extension**: Enables seamless integration with social media, providing pre-upload protection for user-generated content.
- **NFT Minting**: Protected media are minted as NFTs to provide immutable proof of authenticity.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, Hugging Face
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Polygon (Testnet)
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
1. **Media Upload**: Users upload content (image, audio, video) to Guard.AI.
2. **Deepfake Detection**: Our AI models analyze the media for signs of manipulation, providing confidence scores and highlighting areas of concern.
3. **Immunization**: If desired, users can protect their media by applying a unique fingerprint using our proprietary algorithm.
4. **Decentralized Storage**: The media is stored securely on IPFS, and its authenticity is recorded on the blockchain.
5. **NFT Minting**: Once the media is protected, it is minted as an NFT to ensure immutable verification.
